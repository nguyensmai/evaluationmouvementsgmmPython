## evaluationmouvementsgmmPython
This is a Python3 version of 'EvaluationMouventsgmm' using the library "riepypbdlib". 

Same as the master branch, to start the program, use the commands below. 

```
python mainLearning_pbdlib.py
python mainEvaluation.py
```
However, its speed is far lower than master branch, and it doesn't return exactly the same result.
